# Understanding JWT Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have become the standard for implementing authentication in modern web applications. At Nike, we implemented a robust JWT-based authentication system that could handle millions of users securely.

# Key Components

Our JWT implementation consisted of several key components:

- Token Generation and Validation
- Secure Storage and Transmission
- Refresh Token Mechanism
- Rate Limiting and Security Measures

# Implementation Details

## Token Structure

We structured our JWTs with the following claims:

- `sub`: Subject (user ID)
- `iat`: Issued at time
- `exp`: Expiration time
- `aud`: Audience (application identifier)
- Custom claims for role-based access

## Security Measures

To ensure maximum security, we implemented:

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Token blacklisting for revoked tokens

# Best Practices

Here are some key best practices we followed:

1. Always validate token signatures
2. Use strong encryption algorithms (RS256)
3. Implement proper token revocation
4. Monitor for suspicious activities
5. Regular security audits

# Lessons Learned

The implementation taught us valuable lessons about:

- Importance of proper token management
- Need for comprehensive security measures
- Value of monitoring and logging
- Benefits of standardized authentication
